# Introspection Junction

## Description

  - This project is the backend for a social media site where you share your thoughts about anything with other users and they can react to your thoughts.
  - I was very excited to use MongoDB as the database for this project. After using relational databases for many years it was refreshing to us a document database because the relaxed schema makes development easier and faster.
  - I wanted to use MongoDB for the database but I also wanted to have schema rules and Mongoose provided that. I am very excited to be using these newer technologies.
  - This project provides the foundation for a social media site where users can store their thoughts and have other users as friends who can react to thier thoughts.
  - I learned how to use MongoDB for the database and Mongoose for the ODM library.
